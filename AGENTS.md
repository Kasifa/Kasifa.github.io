# Published writing style

These rules apply to reader-facing text in `public/`, page metadata, research notes, and downloadable versions.

- Write as one individual researcher. Use first-person singular (`我`) for choices, plans, progress, and uncertainty. Use a neutral voice for established mathematics.
- Keep sentences plain, short, and specific. Prefer “我目前在检查……” to slogans about a “main attack”, “breakthrough”, or “research program”.
- Avoid collective or AI-like language such as `我们`, `攻关`, `主攻`, `研究纪律`, `三重审计`, `杀死错误想法`, and unsupported claims of importance or certainty.
- State what was calculated, what is known from the literature, what remains open, and what has not been checked. Do not imply novelty or a proof unless the evidence supports it.
- Separate published results, conditional results, preprints, calculations, conjectures, and failed attempts. Link primary sources where practical.
- Keep technical notation precise. Plain language should simplify the prose, not weaken the mathematical statement.
- Before publishing, read the page once as prose and search for the discouraged phrases above. Keep HTML and PDF copies in sync.

# Publishing target

- Publish this project only through the GitHub repository and its GitHub Pages site at `https://kasifa.github.io/`.
- Do not mirror or deploy the project to another hosting service unless the user explicitly changes this rule.

# Simulation and figure archive

- Treat every numerical experiment used in a public claim as a reproducible research asset. Preserve the command, configuration, random seed, environment, git commit, raw or losslessly processed data, and checksums.
- Store paper-ready figure packages under `figures/<study>/<figure-id>/`. Each package must contain the plotting source, source data or a stable data reference, `manifest.json`, `caption.md`, and the exported figure.
- Export formal figures as vector PDF and SVG plus a 600 dpi PNG. Use 85 mm for a single-column figure and 178 mm for a double-column figure unless a journal template requires something else.
- Use neutral titles, explicit units, honest scales, restrained colors, and non-color distinctions. Inspect at final print size and in grayscale. Do not use screenshots as the archival figure when a vector or data-driven export is possible.
- Keep exploratory plots separate from formal figures. A plot becomes a formal figure only after its data, caption, manifest, and visual QA are complete.
- Website figures may be compressed copies, but they must link back to the same archived data and plotting source used for the paper-ready export.

# Compute resources

- Local numerical work may use the workstation's available CPU cores, memory, and GPU aggressively. Keep the interactive desktop responsive, but do not default to single-core execution for independent simulations or parameter sweeps.
- Record hardware, thread/process counts, precision, solver tolerances, and wall time in each experiment manifest.
- Long simulations must expose progress rather than run as a silent process. Preserve a timestamped solver log and a resource log, report meaningful stage/step/residual/CFL/checkpoint/ETA information to the user, and record failures or restarts instead of overwriting them.
- A DGX Spark is available for suitable workloads. Before requesting it, state why the workload benefits from the DGX, the expected runtime and storage, required software, and the data/code transfer plan.
